# ModelComparison2021
Julia and MATLAB code for model comparison via simplicial complexes and persistent homology.

We provide the code, in both Julia and MATLAB languages, for our model-comparison methodology as described in our manuscript: Vittadello, S. T. and Stumpf, M. P. H., Model comparison via simplicial complexes and persistent homology, arXiv preprint: 2012.13039, 2020.

All input data is place in the main file (either Main.jl or Main.m), within the sections 'Input' and 'Input the simplicial complex of each model for comparison'. The calculated distances between the simplicial complexes associated with the models for comparison are in 'dist_complexes', and the distances between the persistence intervals associated with the models for comparison are in 'dist_intervals'.
